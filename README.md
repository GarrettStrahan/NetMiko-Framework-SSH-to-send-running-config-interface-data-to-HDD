# SSH-to-send-running-config-interface-data-to-HDD
First GitHub + First Python creation Very basic prompt to ask you questions to allow the program to SSH into the device you want then it copies the interface information + running configuration into the project folder with .txt files.


I'm looking to add a new version of this code, please be patient I have a couple of ideas just more concerned with learning more python and learning new modules at the moment.
